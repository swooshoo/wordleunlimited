Wordle Unlimited

I love wordle and there exists a wordle unlimited but there are two problems:
1. it loads a stat page after each solve
2. it requires I physically click with my mouse to play the next solve (I would prefer keeping both my hands on the keyboards while I play Wordle)

Features: 
1. stat page accessible via click, not after each solve
2. locally accessible (internet connection not required + small browser window to Alt Tab to)
3. click next with enter button (or not even a next button at all, it could just reset!)
