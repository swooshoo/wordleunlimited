Wordle Unlimited

I love wordle and there exists a [wordle unlimited](https://wordleunlimited.org/) but there are two problems:
1. it loads a stat page after each solve
2. it requires I physically click with my mouse to play the next solve (I would prefer keeping both my hands on the keyboards while I play Wordle)
3. the word takes too long to process (need a faster animation)

Features: 
1. stat page accessible via click, not after each solve
2. locally accessible (internet connection not required + small browser window to Alt Tab to)
3. click for next play with enter button (no need to lift your hand in between each solve!)
